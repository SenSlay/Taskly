# Taskly Demo

## NOTES:

- To RUN: Get all the files locally and Run LIVE SERVER on vscode 

- WHEN ADDING UR WORK TO THE FILE, LET GROUPMATES KNOW AND DONT REMOVE ANYTHING ELSE THEY MIGHT BE WORKING ON
- Use dedicated CSS and JS files for the pages.
- Add .backlog-content or .board-content when styling class names to avoid conflicts. E.g. .backlog-content .modal. Something liek that.


## TASKS:

## - BACKLOG PAGE: NEED 2 MEMBERS

### 1. Sprints - (Name of Assignee)

I already provided initial design for sprints

1. Create a Sprint modal just like below (improve styling) ![alt text](/aseets/image-2.png)
2. When "Create Sprint" button is clicked, open the Sprint modal
3. When the input fields are filled and add sprint is clicked. Add something similar to the below. Instead of start sprint button, replace it with "Complete Sprint" Button, which when clicked, just removes the sprint from the screen![alt text](image-3.png)


### 2. Tasks - (Name of Assignee)

1. Create a Task modal similar to sprint modal when "+ Create Task" button is clicked. In the modal include fields: Task Name, Status for whether the task is To Do, In progress or Completed, and an input to assign the task to someone.
2. Then when "Add Task" in the modal is clicked, add a task to Backlog or Sprint depending where the "Create Task" was clicked.
